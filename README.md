# ⚗️ Current Projects

**Quizler V2**: Recently, I've been remaking my old [Quizler](https://github.com/jacobtread/Quizler) real-time quiz app. I 
have been remaking this project using Rust for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. This remake has greatly improved 
performance and functionality of the server with much more customization and things like filtering names for profanity

**Pocket Relay**: My Mass Effect 3 server emulator named "Pocket Relay" this is a game server for the
Mass Effect 3 game which allows the game to be played over LAN and without connecting to the official servers. 

[https://github.com/PocketRelay/](https://github.com/PocketRelay/)

I've sunken in a lot of time for this project and it spans across many repositories 
that all come together to make it work. 


```rust 
info!("0_0 I even wrote my own SSLv3 implementation to work with the game");
```

# 🔭 That's all 

Thats all the information available in this README file. From here you can procceed over
