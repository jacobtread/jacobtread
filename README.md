# ⚗️ Current Projects

**Quizler**: Recently, I've been remaking my old [Quizler](https://github.com/jacobtread/Quizler-v1) real-time quiz app. I 
have been remaking this project using Rust for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. This remake has greatly improved 
performance and functionality of the server with much more customization and things like filtering names for profanity

**Obsidian Timekeep**: I've been actively working on this Obsidian plugin while dogfooding it to myself. I use this plugin
to track my working hours as well as exporting them as PDFs to easily share.

**Pocket Relay**: My Mass Effect 3 private server emulator named "Pocket Relay" this is a game server for the
Mass Effect 3 game which lets you host your own servers thus allowing the game to be played over LAN and fixes issues that players have run into on the normal servers. 

[https://github.com/PocketRelay/](https://github.com/PocketRelay/)

I've sunken in a lot of time for this project and it spans across many repositories 
that all come together to make it work. 

```rust 
info!("0_0 I even wrote my own SSLv3 implementation to work with the game");
```

**Pocket Ark**: My private server emulator for Mass Effect Andromeda, its in very early stages but is already showing promise
with much of the functionality of the official server being implemented.
