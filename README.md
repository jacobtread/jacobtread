# ⚗️ Current Projects

**Pocket Relay**: I am currently devoting most of my time to my Mass Effect 3 server emulator named
"Pocket Relay" this is a game server for the Mass Effect 3 game which allows the 
game to be played over LAN and without connecting to the official servers.

I've sunken in a lot of time for this project and it spans across many repositories 
that all come together to make it work. 


```rust 
info!("0_0 I even wrote my own SSLv3 implementation to work with the game");
